## 💻 About this project

This app was developed during the first module of the Rocketseat Ignite program, aimed at practicing key **ReactJS** concepts. I applied state management, state immutability, lists and keys, properties, and componentization.

I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

And you can use this project as you wish!
